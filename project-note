PROJECT 2: UDAGRAM IMAGE FILTERING MICROSERVICE
By: Ezra Samuel

Modifications
The project was completed successfully. There were a few modifications made.
-	util.ts was modified to be able to catch an error.
-	package.json - “build” was modified to correct npm run build errors.
-	Also, the image URL given 
(https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Golden_tabby_and_white_kitten_n01.jpg) 
does not seem to be available anymore. Hence, I used a publicly accessible image from my 
S3 bucket to verify. The image URL is: https://ezra-728467082340.s3.amazonaws.com/xander2.jpg.
